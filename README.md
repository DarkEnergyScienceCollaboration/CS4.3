#  A validation framework for the input catalog distributions

Summary -- A system for visualizing and comparing simulated and observed distributions of parameters will be
developed. Any code written to accomplish this will be version controlled and written against the CatSim APIs.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS4.3.1 ( 09/16 ): Using information from [CS4.2](github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/CS4.2)
identify requirements for the validation framework.
* Key Task CS4.3.2 ( 09/16 ): Implement the framework using CatSim APIs and a collaboration standard
versioning system.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
